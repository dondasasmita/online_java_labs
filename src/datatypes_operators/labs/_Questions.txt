Answer the following questions:


1.) What are the names and uses of Java's eight primitive types?
boolean: true and false
byte: two complement integer
char: unicode character
short: two complement integer (16 bits)
int: 32 bits (whole numbers negative and positive)
long: 64 bits
float: 32 bits decimal numbers
double: 64 bits floating point

2.) How do you declare and initialize an int variable called "x" with the value 42.
int x = 42;

3.) What happens if you initialize a double variable with the value of a int?
program will output the decimal, (.0)

4.) How do you set an int variable to the value of a double?
int variable is not possible to be assigned with a value of double. Error.

5.) What are the 5 arithmetic operators?
addition (+)
substraction (-)
division (/)
multiplication (*)
modulus (%)

6.) What are Relational operators used for? What is the result of using a relational operator?
To return a value of True or False. The result will be boolean.

7.) Demonstrate the use of a Relational operator.
x = 1;
y = 2;
z = x + y;
if (z <= 5) System.out.println("It is below 5");


8.) What logical operators used for? What is the result of using a logical operator?
It is meant to evaluate two booleans. The results will be two booleans.

9.) Demonstrate the use of a logical operator.

int a=5, b=15, c=20, d=10;

if(a+d | c-a) System.out.println("The result is ten! You win!")

10.) How can you use the shorthand addition operator to add 10 to a variable "x"?


11.) What data type is a String?


12.) Are string mutable?

13.) How do you concatenate Strings?


14.) Can you cast and int to a String or a String to an int? Why or why not?


15.) What is an array?


16.) What is the first index of an array?


17.) Can you change the size of an array once it has been declared and initialized?


18.) How do you print the 5th element in an array "exampleArray"?


19.) What are the two ways you can declare and initialize an array? Demonstrate both.


20.) How do you iterate through a multidimensional array?


21.) What is the for-each loop used for?
