Answer the following questions:

1.) What is a thread and why do we use them?
    It is a path followed when executing a program. All Java programs have at least one thread.
    We use threads to provide multitasking capability to the program/user.
    For example, MS Word program runs user input and check spelling concurrently.

2.) What are the two ways to create a thread?
    1.) Implement the Runnable interface
    2.) Extends the class to Thread Class

3.) How do you start a thread using the Runnable interface?
    First, implement the class to Runnable Interface.
    Second, create Thread objects and within the parameters pass the objects that we would like to execute
    Third, call the start method on the Thread object


4.) How do you start a thread using the Thread class?
    First, extends the class to Thread
    Second, create method called run in the class, as it will execute when we call start method (from Thread class) in the main method.
    Third, create the object in the main method and call the start method to execute.

5.) How do you change a thread priority?
    We can call the setPriority on the objects and execute getPriority.
