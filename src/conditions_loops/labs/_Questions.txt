Answer the following questions:

1.) What is the if statement used for?
It is used for deciding whether a program should execute or not.

2.) What is good real life application of a switch statement?
It may be used when there are limited number of outcomes.
Example: switch subject in school, case math;  use a calculator; break; , case computer science; use a laptop; break;

3.) What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?
While loop will only execute when certain condition is met, do-while will execute at least once before checking a condition.

4.) What is the difference between a for loop and an enhanced for loop?
For loop is used when we want to repeat a statement with iteration over a range of values.
Enhanced for loop is used when we want to step through an array

5.) How do you create an infinite for loop?
By leaving the condition empty - for (a = 0 ; ; a++)

6.) What is the difference between the break statement and the continue statement?
Break is used to exit the loop and continue is used to skip the remaining codes and iterate accordingly.

7.) Is there a limit to how many loops you can nest?
No, you can nest as many as you wish. However, beware when nesting loops, as they can grow into big complexity.

8.) Is there a limit to how many conditional statements you can nest?
Technically there is no limitation to how many conditional statements we can nest.
